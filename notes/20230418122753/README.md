# Error: `Query options are not valid`

Writing a script I had an error today.

```

I had several queries so I thought it was a wrong parameter or something
in one of those. But the platform logs didn't tell anything else more
helpful.

Then I realized that I am an idiot, once more...

I changed a `findById()` to `find()` and never updated the parameters. I
left a string, which is the id in the log, instead of a query map which
was expecting.
