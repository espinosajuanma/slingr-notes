# Remember to enable History for track changes

The `Entity > Logs` menu have a flag named "Enabled history logs" to
store the record history which is disabled by default.

## Ignore

You can ignore actions as created, deleted, changed, action, etc.

## System events

By default we don't track system events as cascade events. You can turn
it on if you need.

## Expiration

You can set a date of expiration.

## Restore

In the monitor `Database > Entities > EntityName`

You can restore the records to a previous state.

## App logs

History logs are not the same as App logs.

History logs are intended to track the Database.

The App Logs are meant to log detailed thing in the monitor logs and
being stored in the cold log storage for long period of times.

### Environment Settings > Logs and alerts

You can change the settings to store the cold log storage here: size,
times, etc.
