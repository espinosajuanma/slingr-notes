# Use `Ctrl + Shift + F` to find Metadata quick

I'm always browsing in the node tree the metadata I need. Forgetting
that sometimes using this shortcut and the search bar could be faster.

- Press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `F` to focus in the search bar
- Type what you need
- Use arrow keys to navigate up and down
- Press enter when you select the option
