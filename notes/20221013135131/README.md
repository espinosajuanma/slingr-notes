# Always fix field permissions after create an entity

Usually when we create a new entity the field's permissions by default
are empty.

After fix the "Creation", "Access", and all other entity permissions I
have to check the field permissions. Always.

- Select a group
- Go to `1 record selected` button
- Use "Quick permissions"
