# Use the new context menu

I got used to use a lot to open an entity, go to fields, press the
create button. This now is the long and old way to do it.

We have now a lot of contextual menus in the right node tree. We can
open using:

- Right click in the item
- Left click in the icon of the item

## Usages

- On a Package:
  - Create entity
  - Create package
- On an Entity
  - Create field
  - Create action
  - Create listener
  - Create any view
- On endpoints parent
  - Create endpoint
- On listeners parent
  - Create listener

## Summary

It is great to speed up the Slingr developing game. Usually you will
have to order those values inside the view anyway. But it is a great
place to start the job.
