# Developer Portal - Single Sign On - Invalid credentials - User blocked

I had my user blocked in an app after several tries of logging with
invalid credentials. I tried everything to get my user back but I
couldn't log in after that.

Platform team told me that the administrator of the app should unblock
me. And I got unblocked by the admin.

But it seems that in the process of trying to get my password back I
messed up something. I got a credentials invalid trying to login with my
actual email and password.

Diego told me that I should go to the `Developer Portal > My Profile >
Security` and change my password. That fixed the issue.
